Description: Estimation of prescription durations and treatment probability based on 
the parametric Waiting Time Distribution
    Pharmacoepidemiologic databases contains information on medication dispensings 
at pharmacies. Studies using such datatypically require some estimate of duration of 
treatment after a dispensing (known as the prescription duration), which can be estimated 
using the parametric Waiting Time Distribution.
