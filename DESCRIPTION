Description: Estimation of prescription durations and treatment
    probability based on the parametric Waiting Time Distribution.
    Pharmacoepidemiologic databases contains information on medication
    dispensings at pharmacies. Studies using such data typically require
    some estimate of duration of treatment after a dispensing (known as
    the prescription duration), which can be estimated using the
    parametric Waiting Time Distribution.
